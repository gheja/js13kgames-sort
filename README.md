# js13kgames-sort

![Screenshot of js13kgames sort script in action](screenshot.png)

A TamperMonkey script to add sort options to js13k entries pages.

The random sort uses a seed that is stored in local storage so the order
is maintained across page reloads and browser restarts, the visitor will
not lose track.
